# BambooOS

A hobby OS designed and built by Sebastian Crookes with features such as a UEFI bootloader, a higher-half kernel, ACPI support, interrupts, multithreading, PMM + VMM, a heap, PCI support, VFS, FAT32 (and AHCI, not copied from different versions yet). I am currently working on cleaning up/rewriting parts, so this is definitely not the final product.

Below is an image of the project so far. This screenshot does not show AHCI support.
